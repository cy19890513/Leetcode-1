/**173. Binary Search Tree Iterator
Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.

Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST.

Note: next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree.*/
public class _173_using_stack {
    /**This is a super cool/clever idea: use a stack to store all the current left nodes of the BST, when pop(), we
     * push all its right nodes into the stack if there are any.
     * This way, we use only O(h) memory for this iterator, this is a huge saving when the tree is huge
     * since h could be much smaller than n. Cheers!*/
