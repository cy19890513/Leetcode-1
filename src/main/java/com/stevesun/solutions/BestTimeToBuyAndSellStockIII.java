/**123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).*/

         * row is price
         * column is day
         * dp[i][j] means the max profit you can make on day j by doing a max of i transactions.
         *      
         *      dp[i][j-1] 
         *          means no transaction on day j, so the max profit you could get is on the previous day j-1
         *      
         *      (prices[i] - prices[m]) + dp[i-1][m] 
         *          (prices[i] - prices[m]) means you'll sell on day j, this means you'll do one transaction on day j with sell price: prices[m],
         *          and the buy price could be any price that is on the day prior to day j, we call it day m, thus m is
         *          in this range: (0, j-1)
         *          dp[i-1][m] means you'll have i-1 transaction to do on day m to make up to i transactions, since you do one transaction on day j, that's why
         *          we deduct 1 from i
