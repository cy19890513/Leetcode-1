/**
 * Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.

 Examples:
 [2,3,4] , the median is 3

 [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

 Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

 void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.
 double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.
 For example:

 addNum(1)
 addNum(2)
 findMedian() -> 1.5
 addNum(3)
 findMedian() -> 2

     * The idea is for sure to use two heaps, one is max heap, one is min heap, we always let the max heap be one element
     * bigger than min heap if the total number of elements is not even.
     * we could always get the median in O(1) time.
     * 1. use Long type to avoid overflow
     * 2. negate the numbers for small heap to save the effort for writing a reverse comparator, brilliant!*/
